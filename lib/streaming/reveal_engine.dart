/// The arithmetic behind the streaming reveal.
///
/// Deliberately free of Flutter: it owns counters, the widget owns the
/// [Ticker] and calls `setState`. That split keeps the pacing rules — which
/// are the fiddly part — testable without pumping a widget.
///
/// Three behaviours a naive typewriter gets wrong, and this does not:
///
/// * **Lag adaptation.** A model can emit faster than the reveal speed. Left
///   alone the animation falls further behind for the whole reply. Whenever
///   the backlog would take longer than [maxLagSeconds] to clear, the reveal
///   speeds up to clear it in that window instead.
/// * **Fast-forward.** When the stream ends there is nothing left to wait
///   for, so the remainder lands within [fastForwardSeconds] rather than
///   trickling at the baseline rate.
/// * **Replacement.** A regenerate or branch switch replaces the text rather
///   than extending it, and must restart rather than continue from a
///   meaningless offset.
/// * **Per-character timing.** A reveal that only tracks "how many characters
///   are visible" can do nothing softer than a hard cut. Each newly revealed
///   character is stamped with the time it arrived, so the renderer can ask
///   how far along that one character's entrance is and style it accordingly.
